								<p>The base starting price of provided services on the website is $200. Influencers however have the power and the choice (at their discretion) of offering their services at more than $200.</p>

								<p>To create a job request, clients are required to pay in advance. Such job requests can be created by clicking on the job request button found on the influencer’s personal page.</p>

								<p>Influencers have an obligation to fulfill clients’ job requests, and cannot cancel job requests indiscriminately or without cause. Canceling job requests repeatedly will adversely affec influencers’ reputation, status and their ability to secure future job requests.</p>

								<p>Kyndoo users are strictly prohibited from offering or receiving payments using other methods or through other means different from placing a job request on the website or directly other users to other sites where they may also have their jobs posted.  All user relationships that begin on the Kyndoo site are subject to the service and commission fees for up to one year from the last date of job completed date recorded on the Kyndoo site irregardless of how the relationship continues. Once a client has not worked with an Influencer for more than a year then that client becomes “fair game” and the influencer and client are released of the service and commission fees due to Kyndoo as long as they are no longer using kyndoo to negotiate and transact business. If the pair return to Kyndoo useage the 12 month clock begins again.</p>

								<p>All rights to delivered job requests are transferred to the client, except otherwise specified by the freelancer on their Kyndoo page.</p>

							<li>Should a job request be cancelled for any reason at any time before it is deemed complete, the funds paid by client will be refunded to the client.</li>

							<li>An influencer can choose to cancel a job request without the client’s consent, and without any explanation. This will however have a negative effect on the influencer’s status.</li>
							<li>Both influencers and clients are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware. We will not be held responsible for any damages which might occur due to website usage, use of content or files transferred.</li>
							<li>Clients may ask for a revision by clicking on the “Request Revision” button located on the Job request page, if the delivered materials are not consistent with the influencer’s description on their Kyndoo page or do not match the client’s requirements at the beginning of the job request process.</li>
							<li>While the base starting price of services offered on the website is $200, influencers may however offer their services at more than $200 at their discretion.

We may also temporarily suspend the account of such an offending influencer in the case of such violations.</li>
